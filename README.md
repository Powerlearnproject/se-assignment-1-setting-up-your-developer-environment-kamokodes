      3. Insert the bootable USB drive into your PC and restart it.
      4. Enter the BIOS or UEFI firmware settings (usually by pressing a key like F2, F12, Esc, or Del during startup) and set the USB drive as the primary boot device.
      5. Save changes and exit BIOS/UEFI.
      6. The Windows 11 installation process should begin. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
  
   2. Troubleshooting
